**Problem Description:** 
Having images of 3 classes of bean plants (the class of healthy plants, and two classes of disease plants including Angular Leaf Spot desease and Bean Rust disease), build a robust Deep Learning model that will be able to distinguish between these 3 classes with high accuracy. 

**Project Blueprint:**

- 1.explore.ipynb:  data exploration;
- 2.preprocess.ipynb:   the necessary data preprocessing steps, if any;
- 3.model_handcrafted.ipynb:    sequential model construction in a greedy iterative manner;
- 4.model_hyper_search.ipynb:   hyperparameter search and comparison with the handcrafted model;
- 5.transfer.ipynb: transfer learning use case(s) and comparison with the best model;
- 6.optional_1.ipynb:   first optional technique;
- 7.(...);
- 8.optional_N.ipynb:   Nth optional technique.

**Project Objective:** Apply the knowledge acquired throughout this course to tackle a given Supervised Machine Learning (SML) problem.
