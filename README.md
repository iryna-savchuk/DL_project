## Project Deatils
### Problem Description 
Having images of 3 classes of bean plants (the class of healthy plants, and two classes of disease plants including Angular Leaf Spot desease and Bean Rust disease), build a robust Deep Learning model that will be able to distinguish between these 3 classes with high accuracy.
